# Subversive Stack: Not DeFi. Not Web3. 👋

The Subversive Stack is an opinionated framework for developing **secure distributed ledgers**, focused on empowering end-users. We adopt or build tools that prioritize privacy, security, and real-world utility—without promoting token or coin speculation. Our mission: Place users front and center through principled open-source development.

## Key Principles
- **User-Centric Design**: Tools for developers and users who value control and verifiable security.
- **No Speculative Incentives**: We maintain designs free from economic models that encourage value speculation; emphasis remains on sustainable infrastructure.
- **Phased Evolution**: Beginning with permissioned environments (single legal entity); permissionless features (e.g., commonware-consensus) remain out of scope until secure configurations are mathematically proven, and implemented.
- **Not DeFi. Not Web3.**: Our approach centers on secure distributed ledgers, distinct from broader ecosystems reliant on unproven assumptions of security and safety.

## Current Focus: Pivot to Commonware.xyz
We have shifted from traditional blockchain primitives—often based on unproven security assumptions, including lack of formal proofs for minimal thresholds and token-value exceeding minimum thresholds — to **secure distributed ledger** technologies initally via a subset of the [commonware.xyz stack](https://commonware.xyz). This enables verified, permissioned networks while addressing limitations in assumed-secure systems. Key components include:

- Core runtime and primitives for permissioned ledgers.
- Tools for privacy-preserving applications and user-controlled data.

Repositories in this org are forks or adaptations from upstream sources, customized for the Subversive Stack's opinionated approach.

### Guidance for Users
- **Don't Fork Here**: Fork from the original upstream repos to avoid fragmentation.
- **Issues & PRs**: Open them in upstream repos. We monitor for alignment with our principles but have no full-time team—contributions are community-driven.

## Related Organizations
- **[Subversive Upstream](https://github.com/subversive-upstream)**: Tracks unmodified upstream repos (e.g., commonware.xyz components) that feed into this stack.
- **[Subversive Crates (TBC)](https://github.com/subversive-crates)**: Rust crates forked and adapted for Subversive use. Published via GitHub (crates.io distribution TBD).

## Resources
- **Documentation**: Start with [commonware.xyz docs](https://commonware.xyz/docs) for core concepts. Additional guides coming soon.
- **Help Channels**: Use Stack Overflow for questions (tag with `subversive-stack`). No dedicated forum yet—leverage upstream communities.
- **Why Join?**: Develop secure distributed ledgers that serve users through verified mechanisms, separate from speculative markets.

## Contribution Guidelines
We operate as an old-school open-source project: Volunteer-driven, with strengths in community focus and limitations in resources. Submit issues/PRs that align with our emphasis on secure, non-speculative designs.

## Changelog
- **2023-09-15**: Initial release using Substrate (breaking out the upstream Polkadot-SDK monorepo).
- **2025-12-24**: Pivoted terminology to "secure distributed ledgers"; added "Not DeFi. Not Web3." positioning; Pivoted to commonware.xyz stack; de-emphasized Substrate; note commonware-consensus as out-of-scope.
- *(Add future changes here in YYYY-MM-DD format.)*
