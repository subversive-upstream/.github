# Subversive Upstream: Not DeFi. Not Web3.

This organization tracks repositories considered upstream of the [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack)—a secure, user-centric **Secure Distributed Ledger - SDL - (pronounced: Saddle)** stack without promoting any token or coin.

## Guidelines

- **Forking**: Do not fork repositories here. Instead:
  - Fork from the corresponding repository in [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack).
  - Or fork directly from the original upstream source.
- **Pull Requests**: Do not submit PRs to repositories in this organization—they may go unnoticed. Instead:
  - Open an issue in the relevant [Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack) repository.
  - Submit issues or PRs to the original upstream project.

## Related Organizations

- **[Subversive Stack](https://github.com/subversive-stack)**: The opinionated, user-first blockchain stack for permissioned networks. Contains tailored forks of upstream repositories.
- **[Subversive Crates (TBC)](https://github.com/subversive-crates)**: Focused forks of upstream crates, included only when actively integrated into Subversive Stack.

## Resources

Until Subversive Stack significantly diverges from upstream projects, rely on upstream documentation and communities for detailed guidance. There is no dedicated forum for Subversive-specific discussions yet—use StackOverflow with the tag `subversive-stack` for help, though monitoring is volunteer-based.

## Contribution Guidelines

To influence or contribute to Subversive, start via issues in the [Gateway repository](https://github.com/subversive-stack/gateway). Remember: We're committed to speculation-free designs and user-centric innovation. This is volunteer-driven open source—expect the pace and community dynamics of classic OSS projects.

## Change Log

- **2023-09-15**: Initial release using Substrate (breaking out the upstream Polkadot-SDK monorepo).
- **2025-12-24**: Updated for consistency with Stack pivot to commonware.xyz; clarified guidelines and resources.
